    <p>Descripton</p>
    <p>Pav Bhaji is a popular and beloved Indian street food dish that originated in the state of Maharashtra but is now enjoyed all over India and even worldwide. It consists of two main components: "Pav" and "Bhaji." </p>

       <p>1. **Pav (Dinner Rolls):** The word "pav" refers to the soft, buttered dinner rolls that are an essential part of this dish. These rolls are usually toasted with butter on a griddle, giving them a crispy exterior while keeping the inside soft and fluffy. The pav serves as a perfect accompaniment to the spicy and flavorful bhaji.</p> 
        
       <p>2. **Bhaji (Vegetable Mash):** The "bhaji" is a spiced and mashed vegetable curry made from a variety of vegetables, typically including potatoes, peas, carrots, bell peppers, and sometimes cauliflower. These vegetables are boiled and then mashed to a semi-smooth consistency. The bhaji is cooked with a blend of aromatic spices like pav bhaji masala, red chili powder, and turmeric, giving it its distinctive flavor and a vibrant red-orange color. It's usually cooked with generous amounts of butter, making it rich and flavorful.</p>
        
        The bhaji is typically served with a dollop of butter on top and garnished with freshly chopped onions and coriander leaves. It can be customized to suit various spice preferences, from mild to extremely spicy, by adjusting the amount of chili used.
        
        <p>Pav Bhaji is often served as street food, and street vendors prepare it on large griddles right in front of customers. It is a popular snack or meal, enjoyed by people of all ages. You can also find variations of Pav Bhaji that incorporate additional ingredients like cheese or paneer for added richness and flavor.
